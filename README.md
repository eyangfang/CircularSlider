# CircularSlider
This project is based on https://github.com/XamlBrewer/UWP-Composition-Radial-Gauge.git.
The target is to impment a circular slider as a user control. User can change the value by mouse left button click and arrow keys down.
Also add command property to the control. So can add command binding to the circular slider.
